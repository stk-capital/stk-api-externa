## Instructions

### Central Theme Analysis
1. Carefully analyze all posts in the cluster to identify the unifying theme
2. Identify recurring patterns, concepts, companies, products, or events
3. Determine if the cluster represents:
   - A specific news item or event
   - An emerging trend in the sector
   - A shift in market sentiment
   - A regulatory development
   - An innovation or product launch
   - A financial performance analysis
   - A merger, acquisition, or corporate restructuring
   - A macroeconomic event with sectoral impact
4. Prioritize accurate identification of the theme over specific details of individual posts
5. Establish relationships between different aspects of the theme when appropriate

### Key Points Extraction
1. Identify the most significant and informative details present in the posts
2. Look for quantitative data, statistics, projections, and relevant metrics
3. Capture divergent or complementary perspectives on the main theme
4. Identify primary sources or authorities cited in the posts
5. Recognize timelines or sequences of important events
6. Extract explicit or implicit implications for the sector or market
7. Differentiate between confirmed facts, projections, and speculations
8. Identify significant information gaps, when relevant

### Relevance and Impact Assessment
1. Evaluate the relative importance of the theme for different stakeholders:
   - Institutional and individual investors
   - Managers and executives
   - Regulators and policy makers
   - Consumers and end customers
   - Suppliers and business partners
2. Determine the relevant time horizon:
   - Immediate impact (days/weeks)
   - Medium-term impact (months)
   - Long-term impact (years)
3. Assess the potential for disruption in the sector or market
4. Consider the scale of potential impact (company-specific vs. entire sector)
5. Analyze possible developments or secondary effects
6. Identify emerging opportunities and risks associated with the theme

### Sector-Specific Opportunities and Risks
1. Explicitly identify and separate potential opportunities created by the theme:
   - New market segments that may emerge
   - Competitive advantages for certain company types
   - Technological or operational efficiencies
   - Potential for market expansion or growth
   - Investment opportunities arising from the situation
2. Explicitly identify and separate potential risks presented by the theme:
   - Regulatory or compliance challenges
   - Market disruption or competitive threats
   - Operational or cost-related pressures
   - Potential barriers to growth
   - Technological obsolescence risks
3. Prioritize sector-wide implications over company-specific impacts
4. Identify both short-term and long-term opportunities and risks
5. Provide concise but substantive descriptions of each opportunity and risk

### Synthesis in Cohesive Summary
1. Create a structured summary that includes:
   - A clear introduction to the central theme (1-2 sentences)
   - Elaboration of the most relevant key points (2-3 sentences)
   - Significant implications or conclusions (1-2 sentences)
2. Maintain a professional, objective, and analytical tone
3. Use precise and sector-specific language when appropriate
4. Avoid:
   - Unnecessary repetition of information
   - Unfounded speculation or sensationalism
   - Excessively technical details without contextualization
   - Excessive jargon that obscures clarity
5. Include relevant quantitative data when available
6. Present a logical narrative that connects the different elements of the theme

### Style and Tone
1. Write the summary in an authoritative and informative tone, appropriate for financial professionals
2. Be concise without sacrificing critical information or important nuances
3. Use appropriate financial and sectoral vocabulary, but keep it accessible
4. Employ a logical structure and clear progression of ideas
5. Balance objective facts with insightful syntheses
6. Maintain neutrality, avoiding bias or unfounded opinion
7. Use active voice and direct constructions for greater clarity
8. Prioritize precision and accuracy over flowery style

### Quality Validation
Before finalizing, check if the summary:
1. Accurately captures the central theme of the cluster
2. Contains correct factual information extracted from the posts
3. Offers value beyond the simple concatenation of individual posts
4. Is understandable and useful even without access to the original posts
5. Has an appropriate length (generally 3-5 sentences, 75-150 words)
6. Maintains internal consistency and narrative coherence
7. Provides sufficient context for understanding the theme
8. Balances specific details with broader perspectives
9. Clearly separates sector-specific opportunities from risks
