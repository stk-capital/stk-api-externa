For each chunk, include all companies that are directly mentioned and associated with its content.  \\n   - *Only include companies* (do not include any other types of entities).\\n\\n3. **Relevance Flag**  \\n   - Some chunks may be irrelevant (e.g., disclaimers, marketing, promotion, or any content not related to the main material).  \\n   - Mark such chunks with `\"relevant\": false`; mark all other chunks as `\"relevant\": true`.\\n\\n4. **Subject Field**  \\n   - For each chunk, add an extra field called `subject`.  \\n   - This field should be a brief, engaging post subject line (as if for Twitter) that captures the essence of the chunk.\\n\\n5. **Has Events**  \\n   - Add a boolean field `has_events` to each chunk.  \\n   - Set this to `true` if the chunk references or implies any event (e.g., conferences, product launches, earnings call, keynotes or other notable happenings), or `false` otherwise.\\n\\n6. **JSON Response Format**  \\n   - The final output must follow the JSON format illustrated in the example below:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"chunks\": [\\n        {\\n            \"companies\": [\"Microsoft\", \"Google\"],\\n            \"end\": 1,\\n            \"summary\": \"Microsoft is ahead of Google on Cloud.\",\\n            \"relevant\": true,\\n            \"source\": \"Bloomberg\",\\n            \"subject\": \"Cloud Competition Update\",\\n            \"has_events\": false\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"companies\": [\"Apple\"],\\n            \"end\": 2,\\n            \"summary\": \"Apple unveils new AR iPhone at upcoming event.\",\\n            \"relevant\": true,\\n            \"source\": \"Bloomberg\",\\n            \"subject\": \"Apple\\'s Next-Gen Launch\",\\n            \"has_events\": true\\n        },\\n        ...\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n- **companies**: A list of companies associated with the chunk.  \\n- **end**: Specifies the last line (inclusive) of the chunk.  \\n- **summary**: A brief summary of the chunk (1\u20132 sentences).  \\n- **relevant**: A boolean indicating whether the chunk is relevant (`true`) or irrelevant (`false`).  \\n- **source**: The primary source as specified in the document up until that point.  \\n- **subject**: A concise subject line capturing the main idea of the chunk, suitable for a social media post.  \\n- **has_events**: A boolean indicating whether any notable events (such as product launches, conferences, or earnings calls) are mentioned in the chunk.\\n\\n### Chunk Boundaries\\n\\n- The first chunk starts at line 0.  \\n- Each subsequent chunk starts at the line following the `end` field of the previous chunk and ends at its own specified end.\\n\\n### Email Preamble Handling\\n\\n- Set `relevant` to `false` for email preambles (e.g., lines containing \u201cFrom:\u201d, \u201cTo:\u201d etc.).\\n\\n### Source Identification\\n\\n- The `source` field should reflect the primary source mentioned in the document up to that point.  \\n- Do not include the source company (e.g., \u201cBloomberg\u201d) in the `companies` list.\\n\\n### Company Associations\\n\\n- Only include companies that are directly mentioned and relevant to the chunk\u2019s content.\\n\\n### Summaries, Subjects, and Has Events\\n\\n- Provide concise summaries that accurately reflect the main points of each chunk.  \\n- The `subject` field should encapsulate the main idea in a brief, engaging phrase (like a post headline).  \\n- `has_events` should be `true` if any portion of the chunk points to an event, otherwise `false`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\n**Input (lines):**  \\n```\\n0: From:  \\n1: Michael Smith  \\n2: Sent:  \\n3: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 09:04  \\n4: Subject:  \\n5: FW:Tech Optimism  \\n6: From:  \\n7: XUUY Associates  \\n8: Sent:  \\n9: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 08:04  \\n10: Subject:  \\n11: Tech Optimism  \\n12: As we navigate through an increasingly interconnected global economy...\\n13: CLOUD  \\n14: Microsoft continues to gain ground...\\n15: MOBILE  \\n16: The mobile market has observed a downturn in iPhone sales ahead of Apple\\'s upcoming launch of its...\\n17: FINANCE  \\n18: In the financial sector, a new trend of \"AI-first\"...\\n19: FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ONLY -

The quake \u2014 one of the three largest to hit the region in a century \u2014 gouged open roads, toppled century-old religious monuments and destroyed many multistory buildings.\\n27: The U.S. Geological Survey, which tracks seismic activity, \\n28: estimated that the death toll was likely to surpass 10,000 people\\n29: , and that there was a possibility of a much higher toll. A preliminary count from Myanmar\u2019s military government said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities. That did not include Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, which is just 10 miles from the epicenter.\\n30: Photos and videos from the country showed stunning scenes of destruction\\n31: . A giant metal bridge near Mandalay partially collapsed into the river. Monks cried out as a monastery building toppled over. And patients at Mandalay General Hospital laid on the concrete in the 100-degree heat.\\n32: The quake was strong enough to level a 33-story building that was under construction more than 600 miles away in Bangkok, in neighboring Thailand. At least eight people died there, the authorities said. \\n33: Here\u2019s a map of the affected area\\n34: .\\n35: The full extent of the devastation was hard to assess in a country that has largely been isolated from the rest of the world. Electricity and communication lines were down. Myanmar\u2019s ruling junta, which is under heavy U.S. sanctions, made an extraordinary plea for international assistance. President Trump promised that the U.S. would help, and the U.N. set aside initial relief funds.\\n36: President Trump at the White House today. \\xa0\\n37: Kenny Holston/The New York Times\\n38: The legal world is split over Trump\u2019s attacks\\n39: Trump announced today that he had made a deal with the elite law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The firm agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work on issues that Trump supported. The deal was an \\n40: effort to avoid the kind of punishing executive orders\\n41:  that the president recently imposed on firms that employed lawyers whom he perceived as enemies.\\n42: Other firms have decided to fight back\\n43: . Today, two big firms sued the Trump administration, seeking to stop executive orders that could significantly harm their businesses. The firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, had previously employed lawyers who investigated Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\\n44: Vice President JD Vance, center, in Greenland today.\\xa0\\n45: Pool photo by Jim Watson\\n46: Vance went to Greenland, a place that didn\u2019t want him\\n47: Vice President JD Vance, his wife, Usha, and a couple other top U.S. officials spent roughly three hours today in Greenland, a territory of Denmark that Trump has vowed to acquire \u201cone way or the other.\u201d \\n48: He found the weather, and the reception, chilly\\n49: .\\n50: The trip was significantly scaled back after the \\n51: island\u2019s government blasted the trip\\n52:  as \u201chighly aggressive\u201d and residents geared up to protest. Instead, the entire visit unfolded at one of the most remote military installations in the world \u2014 far from any town, or any chance of an embarrassing TV moment.\\n53: In other politics news:\\n54: The Trump administration moved to eliminate U.S.A.I.D. in all but name. The agency had employed about 10,000 people; \\n55: just 15 will remain\\n56: .\\n57: The administration asked the Supreme Court to allow it to use a wartime law to \\n58: deport Venezuelan immigrants with little to no due process\\n59: .\\n60: Robert F.

Kennedy Jr., now the health secretary, said the Trump administration would advise all states to remove fluoride from public water.\\n82: Since 1945, fluoride has been added to U.S. drinking water to prevent cavities. Research suggests it has improved oral health. But the mineral has come under renewed scrutiny, as studies have linked extremely high levels of fluoride exposure \u2014 more than twice as high as people are generally exposed to through community fluoridation \u2014 with lower childhood I.Q.s.\\n83: More top news\\n84: Ukraine: \\n85: After losing much of the ground it gained in a previous incursion into Russia, Kyiv \\n86: appears to have staged another cross-border push\\n87: , this time into the Belgorod region.\\n88: Economy: \\n89: Ahead of Trump\u2019s escalating trade war, new data indicates that \\n90: inflation remained sticky in February\\n91: .
