"Output:[SystemMessage(content='Now, your goal is to split the document given before into chunks. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n\\n1. The chunks should be semantically split by meaning.\\n\\n2. The chunks should have all companies that they are associated with in the response. *Never include anything other than a company*\\n\\n3. Some chunks might be irrelevant. These are usually disclaimers, marketing, promotion or just information not related to the main content. The field `relevant` should be set to `false` for these chunks (conversely, set it to `true` otherwise).\\n\\n4. Additionally, include an extra field called `subject` for each chunk. This field should provide a brief post subject line (as if it were to be posted on Twitter) that captures the essence of the chunk.\\n\\n5. The response should be on the following JSON format of the following example:\\n\\n{{\\n    \"chunks\" = [\\n        {{\\n            \"companies\": [\"Microsoft\", \"Google\"],\\n            \"end\": 1,\\n            \"summary\": \"Microsoft is ahead of Google on Cloud.\",\\n            \"relevant\": true,\\n            \"source\": \"Bloomberg\",\\n            \"subject\": \"Cloud Competition Update\"\\n        }},\\n        {{\\n            \"companies\": [\"Apple\"],\\n            \"end\": 2,\\n            \"summary\": \"Apple\\'s shipments are down.\",\\n            \"relevant\": true,\\n            \"source\": \"Bloomberg\",\\n            \"subject\": \"Shipment Decline\"\\n        }},\\n        ...\\n    ]\\n}}\\n\\n   Where\\n     * `companies`: A list of companies associated with the chunk.\\n     * `end`: Specifies the last line of the chunk, inclusive.\\n     * `summary`: Has a brief summary of the chunk, in 1-2 sentences.\\n     * `relevant`: Whether the chunk is relevant or not.\\n     * `source`: The primary source of the chunk up until it is specified in the document.\\n     * `subject`: A concise subject line for the chunk, suitable for a social media post.\\n\\n6. The chunk is defined as starting from the `end` field of the *previous* chunk plus one, and ending at `end` of the current chunk. The first chunk always starts from line 0. In the example above, the first chunk starts at line 0 and ends at 1, while the second chunk starts at 2 and ends at 2.\\n\\n7. Set `relevant` to `false` for email preambles such as ones that contain \"From:\", \"To:\" etc.\\n\\n8. Identify the inner source of the chunk up until it is specified in the document. If it is a person and it is possible to identify the company they are from you should add to it.\\n\\n# Notes\\n\\n1. Source Identification: \\n   Ensure the `source` field reflects the primary source as specified in the document up to that point.\\n2. Exclusions: \\n   *Do not include* the `source` company (e.g., \"Bloomberg\") in the companies list.\\n3. Company Associations: \\n   Only include companies that are directly mentioned and relevant to the chunk\\'s content.\\n4. Summaries: \\n   Provide concise summaries that accurately reflect the main points of each chunk.\\n5. Relevance: \\n   Carefully assess each chunk to determine if it should be marked as relevant or irrelevant based on the content guidelines.\\n6. Subject: \\n   The `subject` field should encapsulate the main idea of the chunk in a brief, engaging phrase as if it were a post headline.\\n\\n# Example\\n\\nInput:\\n\\n0: From:  \\n1: Michael Smith  \\n2: Sent:  \\n3: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 09:04  \\n4: Subject:  \\n5: FW:Tech Optimism  \\n6: From:  \\n7: XUUY Associates  \\n8: Sent:  \\n9: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 08:04  \\n10: Subject:  \\n11: Tech Optimism  \\n12: As we navigate through an increasingly interconnected global economy, market trends and business dynamics are undergoing rapid transformations. With the Federal Reserve\\'s latest projections indicating a cautious approach to interest rates aimed at tempering inflation without stifling growth, businesses are recalibrating their strategies to stay resilient. This environment of uncertainty demands innovative solutions and agile responses, especially as macroeconomic factors such as trade policies, technological advancements, and geopolitical shifts continue to reshape supply chains and consumer behaviors. In this complex landscape, staying informed and adaptable is more crucial than ever for maintaining competitive advantage and securing long-term success.  \\n13: CLOUD  \\n14: Microsoft continues to gain ground in the cloud computing arena, outpacing Google as AI technology becomes increasingly central to business operations. Microsoft\\'s Azure platform has seen significant adoption due to its seamless integration with existing Microsoft services, which appeals to large enterprises. Additionally, the integration of advanced AI capabilities, such as Azure AI tools, has enabled businesses to optimize operations and foster innovation. The demand for cloud services is also driven by a growing shift towards remote work solutions, where companies require robust, scalable infrastructure to support distributed teams. Looking ahead, the market is expected to further expand with cloud solutions that emphasize security, data sovereignty, and hybrid cloud environments that blend public and private resources.  \\n15: MOBILE  \\n16: The mobile market has observed a downturn in iPhone sales, which dropped by 9% in the first quarter of 2024. This decline is attributed to market saturation in developed countries and the increasing competition from Android manufacturers who offer comparable technology at lower price points. In response, Apple is rumored to be developing a next-generation iPhone with advanced AR capabilities designed to work seamlessly with AR glasses. This move aims to redefine mobile interaction and integrate more deeply with other Apple ecosystem products. Despite the slowdown, the mobile industry continues to innovate, with significant developments in 5G adoption and the rise of foldable technology which are expected to be key drivers for the renewal of consumer interest in upgraded devices.  \\n17: FINANCE  \\n18: In the financial sector, a new trend of \"AI-first\" financial products is revolutionizing how individuals and companies manage their finances. These products leverage machine learning algorithms to provide personalized financial advice, automate trading, and manage risk in real-time. Notable startups have entered the market with platforms that promise to optimize investment portfolios based on real-time global economic changes and personal financial goals. Moreover, blockchain technology is increasingly being adopted by mainstream financial institutions to enhance transparency and security in transactions. The rise of digital currencies and the increasing need for cybersecurity measures are expected to keep the financial technology sector vibrant and continuously evolving.  \\n19: FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ONLY - This message was created by Company XYZ Sales Trading Department and is NOT a product of its Research Department.
