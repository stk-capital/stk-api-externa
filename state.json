For each chunk, include all companies that are directly mentioned and associated with its content.  \\n   - *Only include companies* (do not include any other types of entities).\\n\\n3. **Relevance Flag**  \\n   - Some chunks may be irrelevant (e.g., disclaimers, marketing, promotion, or any content not related to the main material).  \\n   - Mark such chunks with `\"relevant\": false`; mark all other chunks as `\"relevant\": true`.\\n\\n4. **Subject Field**  \\n   - For each chunk, add an extra field called `subject`.  \\n   - This field should be a brief, engaging post subject line (as if for Twitter) that captures the essence of the chunk.\\n\\n5. **Has Events**  \\n   - Add a boolean field `has_events` to each chunk.  \\n   - Set this to `true` if the chunk references or implies any event (e.g., conferences, product launches, earnings call, keynotes or other notable happenings), or `false` otherwise.\\n\\n6. **JSON Response Format**  \\n   - The final output must follow the JSON format illustrated in the example below:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"chunks\": [\\n        {\\n            \"companies\": [\"Microsoft\", \"Google\"],\\n            \"end\": 1,\\n            \"summary\": \"Microsoft is ahead of Google on Cloud.\",\\n            \"relevant\": true,\\n            \"source\": \"Bloomberg\",\\n            \"subject\": \"Cloud Competition Update\",\\n            \"has_events\": false\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"companies\": [\"Apple\"],\\n            \"end\": 2,\\n            \"summary\": \"Apple unveils new AR iPhone at upcoming event.\",\\n            \"relevant\": true,\\n            \"source\": \"Bloomberg\",\\n            \"subject\": \"Apple\\'s Next-Gen Launch\",\\n            \"has_events\": true\\n        },\\n        ...\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n- **companies**: A list of companies associated with the chunk.  \\n- **end**: Specifies the last line (inclusive) of the chunk.  \\n- **summary**: A brief summary of the chunk (1\u20132 sentences).  \\n- **relevant**: A boolean indicating whether the chunk is relevant (`true`) or irrelevant (`false`).  \\n- **source**: The primary source as specified in the document up until that point.  \\n- **subject**: A concise subject line capturing the main idea of the chunk, suitable for a social media post.  \\n- **has_events**: A boolean indicating whether any notable events (such as product launches, conferences, or earnings calls) are mentioned in the chunk.\\n\\n### Chunk Boundaries\\n\\n- The first chunk starts at line 0.  \\n- Each subsequent chunk starts at the line following the `end` field of the previous chunk and ends at its own specified end.\\n\\n### Email Preamble Handling\\n\\n- Set `relevant` to `false` for email preambles (e.g., lines containing \u201cFrom:\u201d, \u201cTo:\u201d etc.).\\n\\n### Source Identification\\n\\n- The `source` field should reflect the primary source mentioned in the document up to that point.  \\n- Do not include the source company (e.g., \u201cBloomberg\u201d) in the `companies` list.\\n\\n### Company Associations\\n\\n- Only include companies that are directly mentioned and relevant to the chunk\u2019s content.\\n\\n### Summaries, Subjects, and Has Events\\n\\n- Provide concise summaries that accurately reflect the main points of each chunk.  \\n- The `subject` field should encapsulate the main idea in a brief, engaging phrase (like a post headline).  \\n- `has_events` should be `true` if any portion of the chunk points to an event, otherwise `false`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\n**Input (lines):**  \\n```\\n0: From:  \\n1: Michael Smith  \\n2: Sent:  \\n3: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 09:04  \\n4: Subject:  \\n5: FW:Tech Optimism  \\n6: From:  \\n7: XUUY Associates  \\n8: Sent:  \\n9: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 08:04  \\n10: Subject:  \\n11: Tech Optimism  \\n12: As we navigate through an increasingly interconnected global economy...\\n13: CLOUD  \\n14: Microsoft continues to gain ground...\\n15: MOBILE  \\n16: The mobile market has observed a downturn in iPhone sales ahead of Apple\\'s upcoming launch of its...\\n17: FINANCE  \\n18: In the financial sector, a new trend of \"AI-first\"...\\n19: FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ONLY -

At the same time, young people are increasingly getting their news from creators and social media.\\xa0\\n26: With these factors in mind, 30-year-old \\n27: Fast Company\\n28:  launched a creator network on Thursday\\xa0to publish weekly articles from independent newsletter writers on the business magazine\u2019s website. The media outlet is starting with eight creators. They include former Mashable tech editor \\n29: Pete Pachal\\n30: , who writes a newsletter about AI and the media industry called \u201cMedia CoPilot,\u201d and \\n31: Jessica Wilen\\n32: , an executive coach and consultant who writes the newsletter \u201cA Cup of Ambition\u201d for working parents.\\xa0 \\n33: \u201cWe anticipated that we needed to find new ways of bringing experts onto our site that were not as vulnerable to the encroachment of AI search, where people never have to leave the answer engine, whether it\u2019s Perplexity or Google,\u201d said Fast Company Editor-in-Chief \\n34: Brendan Vaughan \\n35: in an interview.\\xa0\\n36: These newsletter writers will write original articles for FastCo, which will go through a regular editing process with the outlet\u2019s staff. To run this initiative, FastCo hired a new editor,\\n37:  Jonathan Gluck\\n38: , who previously worked at New York Magazine, Vogue and Medium. He starts April 1.\\xa0\\n39: FastCo will pay these writers a \u201cmodest\u201d amount per article with bonuses for hitting traffic goals, but the real incentive is that the outlet will drive readers to sign up directly to their paid newsletters on the articles they write. \u201cWe think our brand has authority that people trust,\u201d he said.\\xa0\\n40: Meanwhile, independent writers have a \u201cdiscoverability problem on their end,\u201d said Vaughan, who said typically on Substack there has been a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d dynamic, meaning that the top writers tend to make most of the subscription revenue.\\xa0\\n41: All eight writers use the Substack platform, though FastCo said it doesn\u2019t have a business partnership with the newsletter startup. The company is open to working with a variety of independent writers using various services and could also expand these efforts to work with video creators and podcasters in the future.\\xa0\\n42: FastCo, which along with Inc Magazine is owned by publishing company \\n43: Mansueto Ventures\\n44: , isn\u2019t the only media outlet figuring out how to work with creators. \\n45: Last month, Yahoo launched a new creator program, signing up nearly 100 creators on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram to bring traffic to its website. The program pays these creators a share of advertising revenue for posting content to Yahoo\u2019s website. The Washington Post also experimented in 2022 with an advice column written by TikToker \\n46: Jules Terpak\\n47: , though it stopped publishing after five months.\\xa0\\n48: Earlier this week, \\n49: Morning Brew\\n50:  launched its fifth creator-led franchise called \u201cOut There,\u201d led by Macy Gilliam, who goes out into the field exploring various types of jobs. Gilliam has nearly 45,000 Instagram followers, and is part of \\n51: Morning Brew\u2019s strategy to hire creators\\n52:  to write newsletters and appear in other content.\\xa0\\n53: FastCo\u2019s Vaughan expects more media companies and creators to work together, in what he called \u201cboth sides taking the best of the other side.\u201d It\u2019s \u201ca dynamic that is going to continue to evolve.\u201d\\n54: Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026\\n55: The Tick-Tock on TikTok\\n56: \u2022\\xa0President Trump said he would be open to lowering tariffs on China to win the Chinese government\u2019s support for a sale of\\n57:  TikTok\\n58: \u2019s U.S. operations, \\n59: according to Bloomberg\\n60: .\\xa0\\n61: This confirms longstanding speculation about the president\u2019s willingness to bargain on tariffs in exchange for a concession on TikTok. But as my colleague \\n62: Martin Peers\\n63:  \\n64: pointed out\\n65: , Trump\u2019s comments are an extraordinary admission because tariffs are one of his biggest policy points.\\n66: Trump indicated he would have at least the outline of a deal next week, but said he could also extend his previous April 5 deadline. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a form of a deal, but if it\u2019s not finished, it\u2019s not a big deal. We\u2019ll just extend it,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cI have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want.\u201d\\n67: \u2022\\xa0TikTok\u2019s ecommerce offering \\n68: TikTok Shop \\n69: is shifting focus away from livestreaming in favor of getting users to post short shopping videos instead, according to \\n70: Business Insider\\n71: . Livestreaming, which is popular in China, has been a big focus for TikTok Shop over the last year. The company previously encouraged retailers to hold longer and more frequent livestreams\u2014up to 8 or 10 hours at a time in some cases\u2014and offered coaching and studio spaces to merchants who livestreamed, \\n72: The Information reported.\\n73: \ud83d\udcc5 The Creator Upfronts\\n74: The advertising industry is preparing for the annual TV upfront market in May, when TV and streaming-ad sellers negotiate billions of dollars in spending commitments from ad agencies and marketers. Now, creator economy startups are also getting in the mix to try to convince these advertisers to spend more money on creator content.\\xa0\\n75: On Thursday night in New York, \\n76: Spotter\\n77:  will host its first upfront-like event with this purpose. Called the Spotter Showcase, it\u2019s expected to include participation from top YouTubers including MrBeast, Colin & Samir, members of Dude Perfect and Kinigra Deon. Spotter offers upfront financing to YouTubers as well as AI tools for creators. On May 13, social commerce company \\n78: LTK\\n79:  will also host its first-ever creator upfront event for advertisers.\\xa0\\n80: But as my colleague \\n81: Sahil Patel recently wrote\\n82: , the upfronts this year come as advertiser anxiety is rising amid economic uncertainty.\\xa0\\n83: Trump\u2019s constantly changing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and other countries are starting to make brands question how much they want to spend on advertising in the coming months. This is also contributing to a slowdown in\\n84:  projected influencer marketing spending\\n85:  in the U.S. this year. These creator startups will have to pitch extra hard.\\xa0\\n86: Deals & Debuts\\n87: See The Information\u2019s \\n88: Creator Economy Database\\n89:  for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors.\\n90: Spotify\\n91: \u2019s new Partner Program, which pays audio and video creators, is expanding to nine new countries including Germany, France, Ireland and New Zealand.\\xa0\\n92: Instagram \\n93: globally rolled out the ability to play an Instagram Reel at twice the speed, which it said has been a highly requested feature.\\xa0\\n94: Notion\\n95:  launched a creator program which allows creators with more than 10,000 followers to apply to receive free access to Notion\u2019s paid subscription plans and AI tools, as well as events and other programming.\\n96: FiveTwoNine\\n97: , a private membership community offering physical spaces for creators and entrepreneurs, and influencer marketing firm \\n98: Billion Dollar Boy\\n99:  introduced The Creator Fund, a grant program giving creators tickets to attend the major advertising festival\\n100:  Cannes Lions \\n101: in the South of France. Cannes Lion is partnering with the two firms on the initiative to provide 20 creator tickets to the conference to U.S. and U.K.-based creators with more than 20,000 followers.\\xa0\\n102: Big Number\\n103: Goldman Sachs\\n104:  estimates that there are now about\\n105:  67 million\\n106:  people who consider themselves creators globally, up from 50 million in 2022. It expects the number of global creators to grow to 107 million by 2030. The projection came as part of a 28-page analyst note from the firm about the creator economy on Thursday.\\xa0\\n107: Policy Notes\\n108: U.K. media and telecom watchdog Ofcom fined \\n109: OnlyFans\\n110:  about $1.2 million (or \u00a31 million) for failing to provide accurate information about its age verification measures.\\xa0\\n111: Utah\\n112:  this week \\n113: added new protections\\n114:  for kids of creators following the child abuse conviction of YouTuber Ruby Franke. Under the Utah law, creators who make more than $150,000 per year from content featuring their children will be required to place 15% of those earnings into a trust fund for the child when they turn 18.\\xa0\\n115: People on the Move\\n116: Nathan Graber-Lipperman \\n117: will officially launch his \\n118: new creator culture publication\\n119:  \\n120: Creator Mag \\n121: on Saturday in Chicago.
