Look for key indicators of events such as:\\n   - Announcements of upcoming meetings, calls, or conferences\\n   - Scheduled financial releases or disclosures\\n   - Corporate actions and decisions\\n   - Regulatory events or deadlines\\n   - Product launches or releases\\n3. Only extract events that have clear date information (either exact or approximate).\\n4. If multiple events are mentioned, extract each as a separate entity.\\n\\n### Event Details\\nFor each event, extract:\\n\\n1. **Name**: A concise, descriptive title for the event\\n   - Should be specific and clearly identify the event type\\n   - Include company name if it\\'s company-specific\\n   - Example: \"Apple Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call\"\\n\\n2. **Description**: A brief summary of the event purpose\\n   - Should provide context beyond what\\'s in the name\\n   - Include key details about what will be presented/discussed\\n   - Example: \"Apple will discuss its Q2 2023 financial results and business outlook\"\\n\\n3. **Date Information**: The original text describing when the event will occur\\n   - Extract the exact date text as mentioned\\n   - Include time zone information if provided\\n   - Example: \"May 4, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. PT\"\\n\\n4. **Location**: Where the event will take place\\n   - Include physical location or specify if virtual/webcast\\n   - Include relevant access information if provided\\n   - Example: \"Virtual webcast\" or \"Company Headquarters, Cupertino, CA\"\\n\\n5. **Event Type**: Categorize the event into one of these standardized types:\\n   - `earnings_call`: Financial results presentations, quarterly earnings reports, or financial performance calls\\n   - `investor_conference`: Investor-focused events, industry conferences, or financial forums\\n   -

`other`: Any event that doesn\\'t fit into the above categories\\n\\n6. **Companies**: List of company names mentioned in relation to the event\\n   - Include all companies that are hosting or directly participating\\n   - Do not include peripheral companies just mentioned in the text\\n\\n7. **Confirmed**: Boolean indicating if the event is confirmed to occur\\n   - Set to `true` for definitely scheduled events\\n   - Set to `false` for tentative, rumored, or potential events\\n\\n8. **Confidence**: Score (0.0-1.0) indicating confidence in the extraction\\n   - Higher for clearly defined events with complete information\\n   - Lower for events with vague, incomplete, or ambiguous details\\n   - Consider factors like clarity of date, specificity of description, etc.\\n\\n### Event Deduplication and Update\\nWhen extracting events, consider the candidate events provided in the input to handle deduplication and updates:\\n\\n1. **Identifying Existing Events**:\\n   - Compare extracted events with candidate events from the input\\n   - Consider an event a potential match if it has:\\n     - Similar name/title (semantic similarity)\\n     - Same company involvement\\n     - Similar date (within a reasonable window)\\n   - For matching events, set `already_exists` to `true` in the output\\n   - For matching events, include the original `id` from the candidate in the output\\n   - For new events not matching any candidates, set `already_exists` to `false`\\n\\n2. **Determining Update Needs**:\\n   - When an event matches an existing candidate, assess if the extracted information is more specific or precise\\n   - Set `needs_update` to `true` if the extracted information provides:\\n     - More precise date/time (e.g., exact date vs. just a quarter)\\n     - Additional location information not in the candidate\\n     - More detailed description\\n     - Higher confidence or confirmation status\\n   - If no updates are needed, set `needs_update` to `false`\\n\\n3. **Information Precision Assessment**:\\n   - Consider date specificity: \"March 15, 2024\" is more precise than \"Q1 2024\" or \"March 2024\"\\n   - Consider time specificity: \"10:00 AM ET\" is more precise than just a date\\n   - For time zones, prefer full dates with explicit time zones over partial information\\n   - For descriptions, prefer longer, more detailed descriptions that add new information\\n   - For locations, prefer specific venues over general locations\\n\\n4. **Handling Conflicting Information**:\\n   - If new information conflicts with existing data, assess which is likely more accurate\\n   - Consider source reliability, specificity, and recency\\n   - Prefer information that creates a more coherent overall event representation\\n   - When in doubt about conflicting dates, include the discrepancy in the description\\n\\n### Date Handling\\n1. Extract the original date text exactly as mentioned in the source\\n2. For dates with specific time, include both date and time\\n3. For recurring events, focus on the next occurrence\\n4. For quarter references (e.g., \"Q2 2023\"), capture the quarter period\\n5. For relative dates (\"next week\", \"in two months\"), include the contextual reference\\n\\n### Date Format Standardization\\nWhen extracting events, standardize the date representation:\\n\\n1. **Primary date and time**: Always provide the main date and time in ISO-8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ) in the \"date\" field of your output.\\n   - Example: \"2024-03-26T10:00:00-05:00\" for March 26, 2024, at 10am EST.\\n\\n2. **Original date text**: Always preserve the complete original date text exactly as found in the source in the \"original_date_text\" field.\\n   - Example: \"March 26, Wednesday | 10am EST - 11am CL/BRT - 2pm UK\"\\n\\n3. **Multi-timezone handling**: For events with multiple time zones, use the primary time zone (usually the first mentioned or event location\\'s time zone) for the standardized date field.\\n   - Example: For \"10am EST - 11am CL/BRT - 2pm UK\", use \"2024-03-26T10:00:00-05:00\" (EST)\\n\\n4. **Handling incomplete dates**:\\n   - If only time is missing: Use 00:00:00 (midnight) as the default time\\n   - If only day is missing: Use the 1st day of the month\\n   - If only month/year is provided (e.g., \"March 2024\"): Use YYYY-MM-01T00:00:00Z format\\n   - For quarter references (e.g., \"Q2 2024\"): Use the first day of the quarter (2024-04-01T00:00:00Z for Q2)\\n   - For fiscal quarters/years: Map to the corresponding standard calendar period\\n\\n5. **Timezone standardization**:\\n   - Always include the timezone offset in the ISO date when timezone information is available\\n   - Use Z for UTC/GMT when no specific timezone is mentioned\\n   - Map common timezone abbreviations to their standard offsets (EST: -05:00, PST: -08:00, etc.)\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n#### Example 1: Earnings Call with Date Update\\nInput:\\n```\\nFinancial News Daily - March 3, 2023\\nAlphabet Inc.

Only extract events that are clearly defined with specific details\\n2. For each event, provide all available information from the input text\\n3. Do not fabricate or assume details not present in the text\\n4. Assign accurate confidence scores reflecting the certainty of extraction\\n5. When multiple events are present, extract each separately\\n6. Focus on financial and corporate events relevant to investors\\n7. Properly assess when information updates are needed based on precision\\n8. Handle date updates carefully, especially when time zones are involved\\n9. Consider company name variations when matching events\\n10.
