It allows developers to write infrastructure definitions in Go or Rust, compile them to WebAssembly, and then take input and output from Kubernetes manifests that get applied to the cluster. Yoke has a feature called Air Traffic Control, which is a Kubernetes operator that lets developers define infrastructure as CustomResourceDefinitions - the data in the CustomResource is passed into the Flight you associate with it, and the Flight generates the manifests that get applied to the cluster. Air Traffic Control makes deploying things to clusters easier than ever. \u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

If you\u2019re a long-term investor, you may not care about today\u2019s violent whipsaw that saw the NASDAQ traverse 700 points in the matter of 45-60 minutes.\nPerhaps it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t\u2026\nOr should you?\nNow I participate in multiple timeframes in the market depending on the environment - Daily, Multi-Week, and Long-Term.\nI can tell you this: I have NOT seen this type of violent intraday price action since the darkest days of 2022.\nThe level of uncertainty I saw in the tape today gave me vibes that the market could have an \u201cair pocket\u201d (translation: plunge) if the Administration doubles down on their efforts to wreck the global economy through tariffs.\nThankfully\n\u00a0- we found ourselves at the 200 Moving Day Average for the NASAQ and along with my view that \nGoogle was great value in the low 170s\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

    "content": "Comparison of U.S. and Hong Kong market structures and policy impacts.: \n\n \u00b4\u00b4\u00b4, algorithms gave this region a massive BID. But this BID\u2019s durability depends on some semblance of what the policy outlook will be.\nIn the world right now, there is an exchange of market structure. What do I mean by that?\nAll U.S. investors have entered the price action realm most similar to the \u201cHang Seng\u201d where every single trading day is dictated by what President Xi will do. Now in this instance, it\u2019s President Trump.\nIn this environment for the near term, earnings estimates are secondary and the greater prized skill now is \nhow well we can read Trump and/or predict his policy decisions.\nEven my powerful DCF Model is having great trouble assessing the fair value of stocks because tariffs are making fair value a \u201cmoving target\u201d based on the tariff\u2019s implementation.\nNow over in HK, all HK investors have now entered the price action realm of the \u201cS&P 500\u201d where there is now LESS policy uncertainty than before. Now, HSI is in melt-up mode. Every dip is bought. Every high gets higher.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what trading the Hang Seng is like before its recent rally (which is a departure from its former market structure), now you know.\nI know this because when I was in HK/China in Fall 2024 and traded HSI rather than SPX/NQ (due to timezone) and I can say with certainty that today\u2019s S&P 500 price action is EXACTLY what HSI price action is like.\nUnstable. Prone to random moves. Selloffs feel like we go to Hades. Rallies feel like we are taking a Moon trip. \nBut more often then not, the theme is Mean-Reverting.\nChart below.\nU.S. Market Structure UNTIL tariff resolution: MEAN- REVERTING.\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

The fintech startup is working on a secondary share sale, led by mutual fund Franklin Templeton, at a valuation of $5.5 billion or $6 billion, I\u2019ve learned. That\u2019s less than half the $13.4 billion valuation it notched at the height of the zero-interest-rate startup boom in 2021.\u00a0\nThe company, which sells software to allow banks and fintech apps to integrate people\u2019s financial data, has been on a roller coaster. The company grew rapidly from 2019 to 2022, thanks in part to the surge in funding for other fintech apps and soaring growth for customers like Robinhood and Coinbase.\u00a0\nPlaid is essentially a derivative of other fintechs\u2019 fortunes, which few seemed to understand when times were good. Its 2021 fundraising occurred at peak fintech.\nThen came the slowdown. Plaid\u2019s momentum nearly ground to a halt in 2023 as interest rates rose and growth of new fintech apps stalled. When it diversified its business to sell to more traditional banks, sales grew to more than 25% and annual recurring revenue hit around $400 million. Fintech customers, too, have regained some shine.\nBut Plaid\u2019s valuation hasn\u2019t come close to its old level. The company\u2019s new valuation would be just above what credit card giant Visa had agreed to pay for Plaid in 2020, before abandoning the deal due to antitrust scrutiny. After all that, it turned out Plaid had essentially been stuck in neutral for nearly a half-decade\u2014a victim of its dependence on the industry it serves.\u00a0\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

The company exceeded expectations with an EPS of $1.03 against $0.86 anticipated, and revenue of $1.06 billion against $1.04 billion expected. However, the stock fell due to weaker-than-expected future guidance for the next quarter, influenced by increased costs from a previous outage and customer retention efforts. Discussions among investors and analysts varied, with some viewing the price drop as a potential buying opportunity due to CrowdStrike's advancements in AI-native cybersecurity, while others expressed concerns about the company's high valuation and future growth prospects. The narrative reflects a mix of optimism for long-term growth and caution regarding immediate financial performance.\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

Stripe notes fraud as a central point of emphasis claiming that the most important lever they have to preserve the business is Stripe's reputation network, where they house data from ~$1.4tr in annual payments volume. When a card is used for a payment, there is a >92% chance that Stripe has encountered the same card before, and they can compare this transaction to prior behavior. Stripe provides examples of various techniques used to thwart fraudsters, including: 1)\u2009Building models that are passively learning which shipping addresses are owned by freight forwarders; 2) Use of counterintelligence teams across the deep web; and 3) Use of their Stripe Radar fraud model that can make a decision on a payment based on events that occurred 100 milliseconds ago across the Stripe network (part of which they have open-sourced). Using these methods, Stripe has reduced card testing on Stripe over ~80%\u2009over the past two years, protecting their customers from billions of fraudulent transactions.\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

Stablecoin transaction volumes have doubled.: \n\n \u00b4\u00b4\u00b4Bridge acquisition & discussion of stablecoins: \nStripe announced the acquisition of the stablecoin orchestration platform, Bridge, in October 2024, enabling a number of use cases. According to Stripe, SpaceX uses Bridge to repatriate funds from Starlink sales in Argentina, Nigeria, and other markets. Further, DolarApp, a neobank in Mexico, uses Bridge to help individuals receive USD\u2009payments from payroll providers like Deel, and Airtim uses Bridge to disburse payments to workers all over LatAm. Stripe cites four important properties that highlight the importance of stablecoins vs. the status quo: 1) They make money movement cheaper; 2)\u2009They make money movement faster; 3)\u2009They are decentralized and open-access and thus globally available from day one; and 4) They are programmable. According to the letter, stablecoin transaction volumes more than doubled between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, and the number of monthly active stablecoin wallets has now reached ~40mm. Stripe also gives two comparisons for reasoning about stablecoins - petrodollars and eurodollars. We recently published a recap from our \nFireside with BVNK\n (technically a competitor of Bridge)\u2009where stablecoin adoption and implementation were at the center of discussion, especially as it relates to real-world application, use cases which include merchant settlement (via partnerships with PSPs), stablecoin payments, and marketplace / gig platform payouts.\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

We came away with additional insights with respect to Stripe\u2019s enhanced and expanding enterprise partnerships, Stripe Link (with both card and bank-based funding options), embedded financial services, Stripe\u2019s Optimized Checkout Suite, Stripe Terminal (including the partnership announcement with FreedomPay), Stripe Billing, Stripe Connect, Stripe Issuing, Stripe Treasury, additional payment methods, and more. The day consisted of presentations, panels, product demonstrations/expositions, and fireside chats, including a closing fireside chat with Patrick Collison (co-founder of Stripe) and Lloyd Blankfein (Chairman of Goldman Sachs). While there were a number of announcements and observations with competitive implications across our coverage, we highlight: 1) Continued emphasis on Stripe's platform being available in a processor agnostic manner manner (i.e., Stripe Billing, RADAR, etc. across both Stripe and alternate processors); 2) Further share gains in enterprise (announcing NVIDIA, Pepsi, Rivian, AMC Networks, Cloudflare, Forbes, and ClickFunnels); and 3) Continued emphasis on expanding support for more payment providers and Stripe Link (particularly as it relates to the broader category of autofill offerings from Stripe, Shopify, and PayPal [Fastlane], among others).

Investors first asked the question, \u201cCan the merchant acquiring businesses within Worldpay [45%\u2009owned by FIS], Fiserv, and Global Payments continue to grow ~HSD-LDD with platforms like Stripe, Adyen, Toast, Shopify, Square, Clover (owned by\u2009Fiserv), Braintree, Checkout.com now at greater scale?\"\u2009(analysis of global volumes). Later, the question evolved to, \u201cHow much runway is left in the US in terms of acquiring revenue?\u201d(analysis of US\u2009revenue). Further iterations of this analysis placed added focus on four broadly defined swimlanes within US merchant acquiring: 1) Software platforms (owned horizontal & vertical SaaS businesses such as Square, Toast, Shopify, Clover, etc.); 2) Payments partners (merchant acquirers & PSPs such as Stripe Connect, Adyen for Platforms, Global Payments Integrated, etc. that embed payments into software); 3) SMB direct (traditional payments distribution not tightly integrated to a POS and/or other software platform); and 4) Enterprise and large merchants (direct distribution to enterprise and large merchants). The report also expands upon the software-led channel within the SMB segment, outlining the range of operating model options SaaS\u2009businesses have for partnering with PSPs, including illustrative unit economics implications for both the payments company and the SaaS\u2009business. The intention of the report is to outline the debate and present a quantitative framework for thinking about share gains & losses within US merchant acquiring over the next ~5 years.

Later, the question evolved to, \u201cHow much runway is left in the US in terms of acquiring revenue?\u201d(analysis of US\u2009revenue). Further iterations of this analysis placed added focus on four broadly defined swimlanes within US merchant acquiring: 1) Software platforms (owned horizontal & vertical SaaS businesses such as Square, Toast, Shopify, Clover, etc.); 2) Payments partners (merchant acquirers & PSPs such as Stripe Connect, Adyen for Platforms, Global Payments Integrated, etc. that embed payments into software); 3) SMB direct (traditional payments distribution not tightly integrated to a POS and/or other software platform); and 4) Enterprise and large merchants (direct distribution to enterprise and large merchants). The report also expands upon the software-led channel within the SMB segment, outlining the range of operating model options SaaS\u2009businesses have for partnering with PSPs, including illustrative unit economics implications for both the payments company and the SaaS\u2009business.

    "content": "Analysis of software-led payments in Europe, highlighting Adyen's position to capitalize on this trend and its increasing number of platforms processing over \u20ac1bn annually.: \n\n \u00b4\u00b4\u00b4Europe - is now the time for software-led in Europe?\u2009We think it is\u2026.:\n We address the key question in European payments \u2013 will software-led payments be a key vector of growth for the coming 5-10 years? We draw a parallel with the evidence from the US, where between 2015 to 2020 processors with the greatest exposure to software-led payments experienced strong double-digit growth in their software-led divisions. As a result, traditional in-store payments distribution channels (i.e. banks) lost share. Our hypothesis was to test if this dynamic could apply to Europe. As of today, Europe has not seen such a rise, with bank distribution still predominant in the region (~50% of SME payment volume, vs ~20% in the US). Full report \nhere\n. Adyen best positioned to capitalise on software-led payments in Europe - our Q-Series \nreport\n highlights that we are still in what we believe to be the infancy of a shift to software-led distribution of payments in Europe, with penetration of the total addressable market (TAM) at ~24%. We expect the volume of software-led payments in Europe to grow ~2x the overall carded market at a ~18% 2023-28E\u2009CAGR. Although Adyen for Platforms (AfP) is still at an early stage (~14%\u2009of full stack total payments volume [TPV]), Adyen continues to win logos and now has 22 platforms processing > \u20ac1bn annually (versus 15 platforms at 2Q 2023). We believe AfP TPV\u2009in Europe will ramp alongside penetration increases as it has become a preferred partner for many software platforms in the region. Full report \nhere\n.\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",

In a nutshell, we have rarely seen such a large asymmetry between the past (supportive 4Q24 numbers) and future (conservative 2025 guidance), and consider this stark difference as a clear sign of banks\u2019 being cautious.
